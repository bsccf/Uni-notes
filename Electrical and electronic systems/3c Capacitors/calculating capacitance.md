#### How would you go about
## Calculating capacitance
You can calculate the capacitance of two parallel plates using the following formula:
> $$ C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C=$ [[capacitance]]
>> $\epsilon=$ Permiattivity of material between plates
>> $A=$ Area of the plates
>> $d=$ distance between plates
