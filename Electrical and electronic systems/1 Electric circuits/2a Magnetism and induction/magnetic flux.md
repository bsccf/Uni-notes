#### What is
## Magnetic flux ($\phi$)
This is the normal component of the [[magnetic field]] passing through a surface, we generally measure it in [[weber (unit)|weber]].

Imagine the flat plane as being the surface we are measureing the magnetic field over. So flux will vary depending on:
- Surface size
- Angle between surface and field direction
- Magnetic field intensity

If we are representing the flield direction on a surface we can do so in the following way:

This indicates the magnetic field direction is into the page, if we had circles instead then it would indicate the magnetic field dircetion is going outwards.
