#### What is
## Lorentz's force law
This is the combination of an [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields which induces a force on the charge.
> $$ F = q(E + v\cdot B) $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ Force 
>> $E=$ [[electric field]] strength
>> $q=$ Particle charge
>> $v=$ Particle veclocity
>> $B=$ [[magnetic field]] strength
>> 
>> It should be noted that $E$ is measured perpendicular to $B$ (or vice versa), so you would break one down into a perpendicular component of the other when substituting into the equation.

The more useful form of the equation:
> ### $$ F = BIL $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ Force
>> $B=$ perpendicular component of [[magnetic field]] measured in [[tesla]]
>> $I=$ [[Electric current|current]]
>> $L=$ length of wire

Here we use [[conventional current]] (please read [[reason for conventional current existing|why we use conventional current]] for critical information)

There is also the left hand rule:

For working out the direction of the force on a moving charge.

Notice that the direction is *completely fucked $^{tm}$* in the top image, this is because [[conventional current]] is dumb, and the opposite of the actual direction of electron flow. (please read [[reason for conventional current existing|the complex reason for the use of conventional current]] for critical information)
