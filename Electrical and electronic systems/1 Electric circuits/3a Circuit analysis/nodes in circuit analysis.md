#### What are
## Nodes in circuit analysis
A node is a point in a circuit, it can be along a wire or at a junction. They are useful in analysing a circuit as there are a finite number of unique nodes, we can use these to determine [[potential difference|voltage]] with respect to ground.

Here all the unique nodes are red, green and blue:

The [[potential difference]] between any nodes of 2 different colours will be the same, this is how we figure out unique nodes and break the circuit down.
