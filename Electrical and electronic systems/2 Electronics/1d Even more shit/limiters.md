#### What are
## Limiters
### Intro
These are components introduced to limit voltage within circuits, commonly this can be to protect sensitive components from spikes and fluctuations in supply. Often this is done using [[diode|diodes]].

limiters:
- [[zener diodes as regulators|zener diodes as limiters]]
- [[single diode limiter circuit]]
- [[daul diode limiter circuit]]
- [[diode source limiter circuit]]
