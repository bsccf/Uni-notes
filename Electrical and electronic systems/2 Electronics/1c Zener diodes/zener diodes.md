#### What are
## Zener diodes
### Intro
First of all [[hahaha wiener diode|funny]]. 

With that out of the way, lets get into it. Shockingly, this is actually a type of [[diode]].
If we look back at the [[n-p diode]], we know that if a voltage is applied in the reverse bias there is basically no voltage or current getting through; however a large enough voltage in the reverse bias can get through, diodes that are designed to be used in the reverse bias are called [[zener diodes]].

Zener diodes are usually produced for voltages in the range 1.8V to 200V.

### Theory

Basically a [[zener diodes|zener diode]] exploits the breakdown voltage of a diode, and with heavy [[doping semiconductors|doping]] we can make it so that the breakdown voltage occurs at a practical voltage. As you can see on the graph, a very useful attribute of a [[zener diodes|zener diode]] is that once you pass that breakdown voltage the voltage across the diode (is pretty much) constant. This means that you can use [[zener diodes as regulators]].
