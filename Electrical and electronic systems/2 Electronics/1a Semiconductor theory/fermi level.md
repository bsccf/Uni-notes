#### Define
## Fermi level ($E_F$ or $\mu$)
"Fermi level" is the term used to describe the top of the collection of electron energy levels at absolute zero temperature. This concept comes from Fermi-Dirac statistics. Electrons are fermions and by the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in identical energy states. So at absolute zero they pack into the lowest available energy states and build up a "Fermi sea" of electron energy states. The Fermi level is the surface of that sea at absolute zero where no electrons will have enough energy to rise above the surface.

At higher temperatures a certain fraction of electrons will have energy levels above the [[fermi level]], electrons that achieve this fall into the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]].

The fraction above the fermi level is can be determined using the [[fermi function]]

#### Refrence point when determining fermi level
Simular the temperature, fermi level needs to be defined relative to another, here we use [[fermi energy]].
