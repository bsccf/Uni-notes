## Pauli Exclusion Principle
This is the quantim mechanical principle that states two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, or put in a useful way; it is impossible for two electrons in an atom to have the same properties and since there is a limited number of possible states (spins) electrons can be in any given shell they must be spread out over multiple shells so they remain unique. (atleast that's my understanding of it)
