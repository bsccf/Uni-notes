#### What's the reason for
## Doping semiconductors
### Theory
We already know how semiconductors can conduct current from [[valence and conduction bands in conductors, insulators and semiconductors]].

Doping semiconductors involves adding impurities to them to increase their charge carrier count to create an [[extrinsic semiconductor]].

#### Definitions
![[intrinsic semiconductor]]
![[extrinsic semiconductor]]

#### P-Type doping
This is where you decrease the number of electrons, by adding atom's that have less electrons than those which make up the rest of the [[Crystal Structures|crystal lattice]], these atoms also are [[substitutional atom]]s. Since they have insufficient electrons to bond properly with all their neighboring atoms there are gaps in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] which allows for the movement of electrons within that band and hence conduction at room temperature.

Since the charge carriers are holes the charge carriers are positive, hence p(ositive)-type doping.

In the p-type material, the holes are called [[majority charge carriers]] and the electrons (again excited from valence to conduction band by random thermal excitation) are called [[minority charge carriers]].

#### N-Type doping
This is where you produce an excess of electrons, by adding atom's that have more electrons than those which make up the rest of the [[Crystal Structures|crystal lattice]], these atoms also are [[substitutional atom]]s. Since they have excess electrons but can's use them all bonding with their neighbors the electron is free and can easilly enter the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] at room temperature.

Since the charge carriers are electrons the charge carriers are negative, hence n(egative)-type doping.

In the n-type material, the electrons are called [[majority charge carriers]] and holes (caused by random thermal excitations) are called [[minority charge carriers]].
