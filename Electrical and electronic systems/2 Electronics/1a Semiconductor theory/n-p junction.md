#### What is a
## N-p junction
### Intro
Looking back at [[doping semiconductors]], here's a big brain question: what happens if we slap a [[doping semiconductors|n-type]] and [[doping semiconductors|p-type]] doped semiconductor next to eachother? Will we get infinate energy, does the universe explode, [[does this happen]]?

Nah something much more intresting, we get an [[n-p junction]] (who could have seen that coming?!) it is clearly the best resault as this means that computers exist meaning that we get [[the internet]] and hence [[shiposting]]. ^f31c74

### Important bits
So basically an n-p junction is a type of diode.

#### Electric field formation and charge
Although the total charge is neutral, when the two materials make contact:
- The electrons near the boundary will diffuse from the higher concentration ([[doping semiconductors|n-type]]) to the lower concentration ([[doping semiconductors|p-type]])
- In a simular way the holes in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] will move from a high concentration ([[doping semiconductors|p-type]]) to the lower concentration ([[doping semiconductors|n-type]]).
-  The p-type semiconductor is now negatively charged and the n-type is positively charged (total charge remains neutral but there are clear concentrations of charge within the material)
-  Consequently an [[electric field]] is now formed between the n-type towords the p-type
-  This electric field will continue to grow in magnitude until the strength of the field is equivilent to the strength of the concentration gradient moving charges (an equilibrium is reached)

Note that the equilibrium field strength reached is highly dependent on temperature (recall the [[fermi function]]) due to this effecting the amount of electrons in [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]s.

#### Energy changes
A complicated picture emerges where holes on both sides of the boundary become (mostly) filled by electrons originating predominantly from the conduction band.  In the 
case of silicon, electron energy lost by the ‘jump’ from conduction to valence band is given up to the crystal as vibrational energy. 
Occasionally the energy is converted into a photon due to the electrons changing energy levels, this is how [[light emitting diode]]s work.

This shows the energy bands in the p-type material now slightly raised above those in the n-type material. This is a consequence of the [[electric field]] (E) also shown. 
Negatively-charged electrons that attempt to migrate across the boundary from n-type to p-type conduction bands will need to migrate to significantly higher energy levels if they are not already in a higher energy state. (They are basically being repelled by the negative charge that has accumulated on the p-type side of the boundary and therefore only the most energetic will successfully cross to the p-type conduction band). 
Those electrons that ultimately combine with holes will subsequently give up some of their energy after crossing the boundary.
