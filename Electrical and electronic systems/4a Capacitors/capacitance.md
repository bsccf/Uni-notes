#### What is
## Capacitance
Capacitance is a measure of a capacitros ability to store charge, it is measured in Farads.

It gives us the amount of charge stored per unit of voltage applied to a capacitor:
> $$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C=$ Capacitance
>> $Q=$ charge
>> $V=$ p.d

To calculate capacitance see [[calculating capacitance]].
