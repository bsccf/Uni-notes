#### How can we use
## Complex numbers for representing AC
So [[complex numbers]] are actually ideal for this, especially when dealing with sinasoidal waveforms, take the following equation:

Then by focusing on the real component we get a convenient way to represent the current voltage of some AC source:

So a equation that represents the current voltage of some sinasodal AC source can be written as:
> ### $$ V + xj = V_{p}(\cos(\omega t + \phi ) + j\sin(\omega t + \phi )) = V_{p} e^{j(\omega t + \phi )} $$ 
> ### $$ V = V_{p}\cos(\omega t + \phi ) = Re: V_{p} e^{j(\omega t + \phi )}  $$
>> where:
>> $V=$ current voltage 
>> $x=$ basically [[insert funny|junk]] (not used or loved, cyber bully this variable)
>> $V_{p}=$ peak voltage
>> $\omega=$ angular frequency
>> $\phi=$ offset
>> $t=$ time
>> $j=\sqrt{-1}=$ [[complex numbers#^60fc2b|a cringy alternative to using i]] also [[the j|this]]
