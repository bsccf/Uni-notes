#### Describe a
## DC generator with many coils
### Intro
Basically the same as a [[basic DC generator|DC generator with one coil]] except well... you have more than one coil... ([[insert insulting comment about your intelligence and or something insulting your mother and her excessive eating habbits|it's kinda in the name]])

Here is an example of using 3 phase coils:

The brushes will alwayse be in contact with atleast one coil, ontop of that the waveform will be equivilent to:

As you can see although it is still bumpy it is a lot more stable than a single coiled DC generator, as you increase the coil count you get a increasingly stable waveform, hence it is common for DC generators to have way more than 3:
