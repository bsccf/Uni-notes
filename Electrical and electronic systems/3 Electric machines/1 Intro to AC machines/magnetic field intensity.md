#### What is
## [[magnetic field|Magnetic field]] intensity ($H$)
Magnetic field intensity (H) is equal to the ratio of the magnetic flux density  (B) to the permeability  of the material. The SI unit of magnetic field intensity is $Am^{-1}$:

> ### $$ H = \frac{B}{\mu_{0}\mu_{r}} = \frac{B}{\mu} $$ 
>> where:
>> $H=$ [[magnetic field intensity]]
>> $B=$ [[tesla|magnetic flux density]]
>> $\mu_{0}=$ [[permitivity of free space (magnetic)]]
>> $\mu_{r}=$ [[relative magnetic permiability]]
>> $\mu=$ [[magnetic permiability]]
