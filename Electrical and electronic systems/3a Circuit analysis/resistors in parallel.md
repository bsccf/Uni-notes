#### How do you calculate the total resistance of
## Resistors in parallel
You can simplify circuits by modelling many components that are in parallel as a single component, to do this you can get their total resistance using this method.

$$ \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{R_T} =&  \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}\\
R_T =& \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}
\end{align*} $$ 

The general form:
> $$ \frac{1}{R_T} = \sum\limits^{n}_{k=1} {\frac{1}{R_k}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $R_k=$ the resistance of a component 
>> $R_T=$ the total resistance across them
