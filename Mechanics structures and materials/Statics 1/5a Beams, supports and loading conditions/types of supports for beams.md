#### What are the
## Types of supports for beams
![[Pasted image 20211025093522.png]]

Types:
- Pinned (a)
- Rolling (b)

You can see the reaction force that each can excert, these are the same as the truss versions [[pin jointed truss model#Supports for trusses]]

### New support types

There is also:

This is a fixed/built in support, it differs from the previous 2 as this one excerts a moment reaction force.

### Modelling appropriately
When modelling these supports we need to consider if the system we are modelling is accuratly represented by the model:
- Rolling supports have negligible friction
- Fixed supports have negligible give

One method when determining if a model is appropriate is consider the worst case senario and how it system would behave in it.
