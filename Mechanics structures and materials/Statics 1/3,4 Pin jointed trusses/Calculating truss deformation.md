#### How do you go about
## Calculating truss deformation
The extention of the [[truss]] can be calculated using [[youngs modulus]] subbing in equations of [[Stress]] and [[Strain]].

This is for a [[pin jointed trusses|pin jointed truss]], so there are some primary assumptions we work on:
- Bars extend/contract axially
- Bars are free to rotate around pin joints
- Bars always remain attacked to each other at the joints

It's best to use an example, consider:

If we exagerate the movments:

But in reality, since the extentions are so small you can just accuratly approximate the movement with:
