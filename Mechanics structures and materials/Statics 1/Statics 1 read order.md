Very pog, if you don't believe this to be based... then, uhhh [[you are retard|this]].


### The pog

2) [[Stress and Strain]]
3) [[pin jointed trusses]]
4) [[Truss deformation notes]]
5) [[Beams, supports and loading conditions]]
6) [[Shear forces and bending moments on beams]]
7) [[Shear force and bending moment diagrams]]
8) Look in file 6a and see examples
9) [[Relationships between distributed load, shear force and bending moment]]
10) [[Stress due to bending notes]]
11) [[Bending of beams notes]]
12) [[2nd moment continued notes]]
13) [[parallel axis theorem notes]]
14) [[Deflection in beams notes]]
15) [[Macaulay method notes]]
16) [[Statically indeterminate beams notes]]
17) [[Statically indeterminate beams – double integration method notes]]
18) [[Statically indeterminate beams - superposition method notes]]
