#### What are the
## Basic properties shear force and bending moment graphs
If we start by looking at the following example of [[shearing force in beams]] and [[bending moment]]:

You will notice the gradient of BM is the value of SF *thinking*.

There are also some general rules that can be extracted from this example:
- These graphs often have discontinuities (lots of jumps)
- A [[concentrated force on a beam|concentrated force]] will cause a jump on the graph
- Clear [[MEE Differentiation 1|Differential]] relationship between graphs
