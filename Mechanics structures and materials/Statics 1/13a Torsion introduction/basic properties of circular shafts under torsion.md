#### What are the
## Basic properties of circular shafts under torsion

### Intro

We've tortured these beams alot now, bending them, compressing them ect. Now we're twisting them.

Here we will be focusing on circular beams because, it's going to much simpler. It is also quite a common shape for shafts that transfer power via rotation.

### Modeling
If you imagine lines running parallel to the shafts length, we can represent the effect of a twisting force on the shape of the shaft by distorting the lines:

Note that the cross section shape dosn't change dimentions, a 2D slice remains completely unchanged.

Now lets consider this further by creating a cut half within the beam:

We can see that if the cut face of the beam was deformed via "bulging" then the two faces wouldn't connect anymore, hence we assume that there is no bulging in the beam, hence the length of the beam dosn't change due to torsion (in this model).

As a consequence of these observations the radial lines of the cross section of the beam remain strait.
