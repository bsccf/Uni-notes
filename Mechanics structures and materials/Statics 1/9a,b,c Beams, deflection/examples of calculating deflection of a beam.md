# examples of calculating deflection of a beam

Here you can see how the equations relate over the distance of the beam.


## Example 2

As you can see (especially without subbing in real values) it is a massive pain in the ass to calculate deflection when the beam has distinct area's. So that is what we get a good method for in the next section.
