#### What is a
## Neutral surface and neutral axis
#### Neutral surface
Between two surfaces that are in compression and tension there must be points along that stress gradient where stress = 0. Since compression and tension are continous throughout a material it could be shown as a surface, hence a neutral surface:

It is useful to define, because then we can figure out stresses relative to it.
It should also be noted that since stress=0 the length of the neutral surface is constant.

#### Neutral axis
This is just the line that the neutral surface makes with the cross section of a beam:

Also note that the total moments above and below don't need to be equal, which is really annoying because I thought that was the case and it would have [[simplified my working.]]
