#### How do we go about
## Modeling shear stress in beams
### Intro
First it is useful to consider all the shear forces acting through the beam.

#### Longitudinal distribution
We already know how to model the internal [[strains effects on cross section of a beam]] that resault from moments, which leads into the following stress distrobution over a beams cross section:

This shows us that [[shear stress]] ($\sigma_{xx}$) must exist in the longitudinal axis of the beam.

#### Verticle distribution
From some of the first content in [[shearing force in beams]] we know that $Q$ is a verticle shear stress ($\sigma_{yx}$):

Showing us that there is a verticle shear stress.

#### Horizontal distrobution
Since the beam isn't rotating around its centre there must be a force countering rotation:

These forces would manifest as shear forces in the horizontal planes.

### The importance of shear stress
If we imagine a situation with 2 beams of identical situations except one is cut into a series of layers with not shear stresses between them:

We can clearly see that without that shear stress a great amount of strength is lost, this links back to the effective [[second moment of area]] of the comparative beams.
