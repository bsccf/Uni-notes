#### How do you calculate
## Differentiation and integration of a step function
> ### $$ \frac{d}{dx}a[x-k]^b = ab[x-k]^{b-1} $$
> ### $$ \int a[x-k]^{b} \cdot dx = \frac{a[x-k]^{b+1}}{b+1} $$
>> where:
>> $x=$ A variable
>> $k,a,b =$ Constants

As you can see differentiation and integration work the same, make sure never to expand these though.
