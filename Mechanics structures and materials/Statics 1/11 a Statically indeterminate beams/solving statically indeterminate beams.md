#### What is the method for
## Solving statically indeterminate beams
### Basic idea
We know that is is impossible to solve [[statically determinate and indeterminate beams|statically indeterminate beams]] from their forces alone. 

So to find the unknowns we will need more equations that express the relationships of these forces.

If we know the deflection of the beam, we can get more equations and hence may be able to solve for the forces.
