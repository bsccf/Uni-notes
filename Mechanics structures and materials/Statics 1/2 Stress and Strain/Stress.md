#### What's
## Stress
This is the force over an objects cross sectional area:

> $$ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma =$ Stress ($N/m^2$)
>> $F =$ Force ($N$)
>> $A =$ Area ($m^2$)

There are two important stress values that you should also be aware of:
- [[ultimate tensile strength]]
- [[yield strength|Yield stress]]
