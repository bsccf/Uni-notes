#### What is
## Stress safety factor
This is the factor of safety of what the design expects to expereince vs the [[ultimate tensile strength]] of the material
> $$ \sigma_{max\:design} = \frac{1}{K_{SF}}\sigma_{max\:material} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K_{SF} =$ safety factor $(K_{SF} > 1)$ 
>> $\sigma_{max\:design} =$ The maximum [[Stress]] the material is expected to experience
>> $\sigma_{max\:material} =$ The [[ultimate tensile strength]] of the material
