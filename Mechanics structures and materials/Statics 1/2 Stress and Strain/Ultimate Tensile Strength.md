#### What's 
## Ultimate Tensile Strength
This is the maximum [[Stress]] that a material can experience before fracture.

When plotting with [[engineering stress and strain|engineering stress]] the stress may appear to drop before final failure, this is because the cross sectional area is decreasing and we arn't accounting for it properly.

The ultimate tensile strength is point M on this graph.
