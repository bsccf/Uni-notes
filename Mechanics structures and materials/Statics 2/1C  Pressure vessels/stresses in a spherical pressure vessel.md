#### How can we find
## Stresses in a spherical pressure vessel
### Equation
Since it's a sphere the stresses will be the same in all directions at all points.

> ### $$ \sigma_{xx} = \sigma_{yy} = \frac{pR}{2t} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma=$ stress 
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $R=$ Radius of sphere
>> $t=$ wall thickness
>> $\frac{t}{R}\leq 0.1$

### Proof
It is litterally the same as [[stresses in a cylindrical pressure vessel#^b3611c]]
