#### What is a
## Strain guage
### What they do
These are devices that can measure very small strains in one direction:

Basically they work by using a thin wire, if the wire is stretched it becomes longer and thinner increasing resistance, this resistance change can then be used to calculate strain using [[yeah no I cba|math magic]]. (It's on the slides but I don't think we need to know more about the circuit behind this)

### Limitations
- Must be glued well, since if it doesn't deform in the same way as the material it's readings kinda useless
- Only measures in one direction
