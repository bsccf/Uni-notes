#### What is a
## Impulse
A impulse is basically the change in momentum due to force over some time period:

$$\begin{align*}
F &= ma\\
&= m \frac{dv}{dt}\\
\int^{t_{2}}_{t_{1}} F dt &=\int^{v_{2}}_{v_{1}} m dv\\
&= mv_{2} - mv_{1}\\
&= Impulse
\end{align*}$$

> ### $$ m_{2}\underline{v_{2}} - m_{1}\underline{v_{1}} = \int^{t_{2}}_{t_{1}} \underline{F} dt $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{v_{1}}=$ initital velocity 
>> $\underline{v_{2}}=$ final velocity
>> $\underline{F}=$ Force [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] as a function of time
>> The stuff going on with $m$ is to show that if for some reason $m$ changes it needs to be accounted for (doubt you ever will need to but [[trol|idk]])

It should be noted that if force is a constant then $m\underline{v_{2}} - m\underline{v_{1}} = \underline{F}(t_{2}-t_{1})$ because well, use ya brain.

Its also equal to the area under a force time graph because well... use ya brain.
