#### Define mathamatically
## Velocity and speed
Sometimes people use velocity and speed interchangably, which is wrong.

Actual [[velocity and speed|velocity]] is the rate of change of your position [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]:

> ### $$ \bar{v} = \frac{d\bar{s}}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{v}=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $\bar{s}=$ position [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $t=$ time

You can get [[velocity and speed|speed]] by using the change in magnitude of your position vector over time:

> ### $$ v = \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d|\bar{s}|}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $v=$ [[velocity and speed|speed]]
>> $s=$ position as a [[Scalars and vectors|scalar]]
>> $\bar{s}=$ position [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $t=$ time

Also this is average velocity:

> ### $$ v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} $$ 
>> where:
>> $v_{avg}=$ average velocity 
>> $\Delta s=$ change in position
>> $\Delta t=$ change in time
