#### Describe
## Gravitational attraction
Any two objects have a mutually attractive gravitational force between them, defined by:

> ### $$ F_{g} = G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $G=$ [[universal constant of gravitation]]
>> $m_1,m_2=$ mass of the bodys
>> $r=$ distance between them
>> $F_{g}=$ force due to gravity also known as weight

You can also convert this to get acceleration due to gravity by dividing by $m$:
> ### $$ g(r) = G \frac{M}{r^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $g(r)=$ acceleration due to gravity as a function of $r$ 
>> $G=$ [[universal constant of gravitation]]
>> $r=$ distance from body
>> $M=$ mass of body being attracted to
