#### What is
## Static friction force

Basically this models friction as being directly proportional to the normal reactive force between two surfaces in contact within limits:

> ### $$ \begin{align*}\mu_{s} N<F_{smax}&: \: F_{s} = \mu_{s} N\\ \mu_{s} N\geq F_{smax}&: \: F_{s} = F_{smax} \end{align*} $$ 
>> where:
>> $F_{s}=$ [[static friction force]]
>> $F_{smax}=$ maximum frictional force
>> $\mu_{s}=$ [[static friction force|coefficient of static friction]]
>> $N=$ The normal reaction force between the two surfaces

The [[static friction force|coefficient of static friction]] is between 0 and 1. It basically describes resistance to motion between the two surfaces.

Note that [[static friction force]] cannot be applied to moving objects, that is where [[dynamic friction force]] is used! 
There are also a bunch of important limitations on this model of friction [[dynamic friction force#Limitations|that can be found here]].
