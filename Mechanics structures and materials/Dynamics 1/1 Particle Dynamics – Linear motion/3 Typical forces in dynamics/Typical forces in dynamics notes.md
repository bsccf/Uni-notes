#### Intro and contents
These are just a bunch of forces that come up quite often so you should be aware of them, here's one you might of heard of before it's called gravity:
- [[gravitational attraction]]
- [[static friction force]]
- [[dynamic friction force]]
- [[tension and compression force]]
- [[drag force (dynamics)]]
- [[buoyancy force]]

## Expanded articles
