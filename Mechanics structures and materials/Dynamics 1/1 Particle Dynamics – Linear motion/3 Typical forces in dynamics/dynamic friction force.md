#### What is
## Dynamic friction force
### Important bits
Simular to [[static friction force]] except applies to moving objects.
> ### $$ F_{k} = \mu_{k} N $$

>> $F_{k}=$ [[dynamic friction force]]
>> $\mu_{k}=$ [[dynamic friction force|dynamic friction coefficient]]
>> $N=$ normal reaction force

As you can see it's very simular to [[static friction force#^d66e31]] but the coefficient's swapped out and the limit's are removed. The [[dynamic friction force|coefficient of dynamic friction]] $\mu_k$ is generally less that the situations [[static friction force|coefficient of static friction]]:
$$ \mu_{k} < \mu_{s} $$

### Limitations
There are some problems with both [[dynamic friction force]] and [[static friction force]], both don't work on lubricated surfaces, friction doesn't account for relative speed and it doesn't account for contact area. So if when you saw the equation origionally you thought "that seems wrong", well done your right. Though it is a descent description of behaviour "friction increases with contact force, with different behaviour when static and when moving" so it's what is used in this module.
