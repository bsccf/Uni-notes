#### Describe
## Acceleration in the [[n-t diagram|n-t coordinate system]]

> ### $$ \begin{align*}a &= \frac{d\underline{v}}{dt} \\&= \dot{v}\underline{u_{t}} + v \dot{\underline{u_{t}}} \\&= \dot{v}\underline{u_{t}} + \frac{v^{2}}{\rho}\underline{u_{n}} \\&= a_{t} \underline{u_{t}} + a_{n} \underline{u_{n}}\end{align*} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{u_{n}}=$ unit vector of normal
>> $\underline{u_{t}}=$ unit vector of tangent
>> $\underline{v}=v \underline{u_{t}}=\dot{s}=$ velocity vector
>> $v=$ magnitude of velocity ([[velocity and speed|speed]])
>> $s=$ position along curve

The thing that makes all this a real pain in the ass, is the fact that acceleration can vary, then ontop of that you can get acceleration acting in both the n and t axis:

Hence you need to be aware of the difference between $a$ and $\underline{a}$ (be careful with [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]] because I'm [[this will cause problems|lazy enough to forget to underline variables quite often, and lets be honest you are too]])

>> $v=$ speed

This is a basic circular motion equation, just with fucky variables instead of the easy $a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$
