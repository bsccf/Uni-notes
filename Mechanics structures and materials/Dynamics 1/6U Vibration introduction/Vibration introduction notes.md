# Vibration introduction notes

#### Intro and contents
This is essentially the dynamics version of [[modelling oscillations of damped elastic systems using constant-coefficient differential equations]]:
- [[equivalent springs]]
- [[springs in parallel and series]]
- [[modeling vibration (not driven)]]
- [[types of dampening (dynamics)]]
- [[undamped free vibration (dynamics)]]
- [[under damped natural frequency]]
