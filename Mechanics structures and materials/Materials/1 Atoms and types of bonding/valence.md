#### What is
## Valence
The valence of an atom of an element is a measure of it's capacity to combine with other atoms when forming compounds or molecules. It is measured by the number of bonds the atom in the compound forms.

Or the modern definition: Valence is the number of hydrogen atoms that may combine with an atom of the element under consideration.

| Element  | Compund   | Valence |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| Hydrogen | $H_2$     | 1       |
| Carbon   | $CH_4$    | 4       |
| Hydrogen | $CH_4$     | 1       |
| Nitrogen | $NH_3$    | 3       |
| Hydrogen | $NH_3$    | 1       |
| Sulfur   | $H_2SO_4$ | 6       |
| Oxygen   | $H_2SO_4$ | 2       |
| Hydrogen | $H_2SO_4$ | 1       |
