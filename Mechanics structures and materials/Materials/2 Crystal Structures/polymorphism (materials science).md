#### What is
## Polymorphism (materials science)
This is when materials can have more than one crytal structure, differences between its structures and the conditions needed to initiate a shift between them can lead to problematic effects or usefull effects. 

For example, tin transforms from body centred tetragonal to a diamond style structure at 13.2C, but this causes a 27% volume increase which leads to tin shredding itself as it expands causing lots of problems.

It should also be noted that when polymorphism is used to our benefit you get some very neat materials.
