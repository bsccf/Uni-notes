#### What is
## Dislocation motion
This is a method through which [[dislocations]] causes plastic deformation:

You can see how and [[edge dislocation]] moves through a lattice as a shear stress is applied, this creates a tiny change to the shape of the material; the sheare quantity of these occuring however has macroscopic effects.
This occurs because the motion of reforming/breaking one row at a time requires much less energy than slipping the whole plane, hence it is more common.
