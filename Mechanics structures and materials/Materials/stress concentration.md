#### What is the distrobution of
## [[Stress]] concentration
If you imagine stress across a plate as acting along infinate parrallel lines along the plate:

Then you can imagine that when a gap is introduced into the material these stress lines divert around it, but they will accumulate around the edges of these gaps. This means that at these points at the edges of gaps stress is much higher than the average stress, since the material at these points has the same properties as the rest of the material fracture will occur at these points before other points in the material, this leads to a lower overall material strength.

Here is a graphical representation of the diagram above:

### Calculating stress concentration

![[Pasted image 20211125124009.png]]

> ### $$ \sigma_m = 2 \sigma_0 \sqrt\frac{a}{\rho_t} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_m=$ Stress at the crack tip 
>> $\sigma_0=$ Applied stress along material
>> $a=$ crack surface length
>> $\rho_t=$ The [[radius of curvature]] of the tip

#### Implications
- $a$, Larger cracks create a stronger intensification at the crack edges
- $\rho_t$, Sharper edges greatly intensifys stress concentrations at them
