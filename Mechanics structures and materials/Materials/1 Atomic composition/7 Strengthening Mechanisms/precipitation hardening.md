#### What is
## [[haha funny me in your mum joke|Precipitation hardening]]
This is when a precipitate forms inside ([[internal crystal grain precipitation]]) another material. This can be achieved through various methods that I cannot be asked to go into.

### Types of precipitate

Larger precipitates are more likely to be incoherent.

### Effect on hardness

Hard precipitates of a different structure inside the metal are difficult to shear and act as barriers to [[dislocation motion]].
It is also possible for dislocations to be [[pinning (materials)|pinned]].
