#### How would you go about
## Representing crystallographic directions
They can be represented using the format [XYZ] where:

> $$ [XYZ] $$ 
>> where:
>> $X=\frac{1}{x}$ 
>> $Y=\frac{1}{y}$
>> $Z=\frac{1}{z}$

Below you can see examples of this

Note that $\bar{1}$ means $-1$

#### General direction
This is formatted as $<XYZ>$, they are basically a direction that can be rotated 90 degrees around the x,y,z axis' to give other directions.

In this example $[011],[101],[\bar{1}10]$ all have the general direction $<110>$.
