[[yield strength|yield stress]] is effected differently by in different crystal structures.

Generally temperature decreases material strength but you can see it varys greatly with structures:
- [[face centred cubic|FCC]] - Not effected much by temp because slip is easy because of it's close packed planes
- [[body centred cubic|BCC]] - Very temperature dependent because there are no close packed planes
- [[hexagonal close packing|HCP]] - Temperature dependent since there are limited close-packed slip systems
