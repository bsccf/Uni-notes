#### What is the
## Effect of alloying on dislocation motion
Alloying creates area's of compression and tension within a [[Crystal Structures|crystal structure]], these inhibit [[dislocation motion]] and increase [[yield strength|yield point]]. 
There are a few types of atoms that should be defined in an alloy:
- [[interstitial atom]]
- [[substitutional atom]]
