#### What is
## Polymer crystallinity
### Intro
When cooling from a liquid to a solid the polymer can become:
- a crystalline solid, its polymer chains form repeating pattern
- a amorphous solid, it's chains are irregularly structured
- somewhere between the two (semicrystalline), it has areas of both

In reality just about all polymers fall into the 3rd catagory, even then they can get incredibly close to either extreme:

#### Volume properties
More [[crystalline materials|crystalline]] polymers will also have greater densitys:

Since the chains can become more closely packed.

Elaboration on graph symbols:
- ($T_g$) [[glass transition temperature (polymers)]]
- ($T_m$) melting temperature

### Detail on these types
#### Crystalline polymers
The most common formation is a twisted lamellar ribbon structure.

- High densitys as chains can pack closer together
- High strength due to [[van der waals force]]s between adjacent chains

#### Amorphus polymers
- Not that dense as the chains don't pack tightly
- Less contact between chains reduces effect of [[van der waals force]] hence weaker

#### Semicrystalline polymer
As stated previously a true [[polymer crystallinity|crystalline polymer]] is basically impossible, the [[polymer chain length distrobution]] contributes to this as the different length polymers can't really form a true repeating structure, but as stated you can still have regions of crystallinity:

Hence depending on how crystalline or amorphous it is changes which ones properties it resembles more.
