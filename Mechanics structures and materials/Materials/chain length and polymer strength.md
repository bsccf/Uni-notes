#### What is the relationship
## Chain length and polymer strength

We know that in polymers the [[polymer chain length distrobution]] covers a range, but we can get an idea of the overall properties of a [[polymers|polymer]] material based by focusing on the impications of the length of an idividual polymer chain.

Lets consider a incredibly long polymer chain:
- It can get tangled with many other chains over a large area
- This leads to a great contribution to overall material strength

Now if we consider an incredibly short polyer chain:
- It can't tangle effectively
- Short enough chains could act more like a fluid than a firm structure
- Contribute little to overall material strength

Of course chain's exist on a spectrum between these two extremes, but as you can see longer chains will generally resault in a higher [[ultimate tensile strength]].
