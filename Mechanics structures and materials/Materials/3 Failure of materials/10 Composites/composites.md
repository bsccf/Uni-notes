#### What are
## Composites
### Intro
These are multi[[phase (materials)|phase]] components that have two or more dissimular consitituents to improve desired properties. 
There properties will have aspects of the properties of the materials that compose them.
Behaviour under load can often vary depending on the direction the load is applied on (depends on the composite if this is true).

Hence properties are defined by materials, reinforcement distribution, design and processing route.

### Composition
A [[composites|composite]] contains a:
- [[matrix (materials)|matrix]]
- [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]]
