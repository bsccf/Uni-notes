#### What are methods for
## Protecting against corrosion
### Oxide formation
Although all of these processes kinda suck, not all corrosion is bad, people are creative and have found methods of using it to our advantage.

The formation of oxides on the surface of a metal can create a protective barrier that is insulative and inhibits ion diffusion. Which then leads to reduced corrosion.

### Metal [[passivation]]
- Aluminium and Chromium develop an oxide layer which is adheres well, is coherent (defect free) and thus protective
- Steel mixed with 12% chromium – Cr oxidises preferentially on the surface and produces an impervious protective Cr2O3 layer (stainless steels)
- CoCrMo alloys used in hips ~26-30% Cr for protective Cr2O3 layer
- Aluminium can be anodised to increase the thickness of the oxide layer (drive more oxidation electrochemically) – oxide layer is protective
