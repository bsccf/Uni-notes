#### What is
## Selective leaching (corrosion)
The case wherein one element/constituent of an alloy is removed selectively by corrosive action. Hence why it's also called [[selective leaching (corrosion)|dealloying]], since it resaults in the selective removal of important elements.

Not really a diagram since as you can imagine so many processes can cause this.
