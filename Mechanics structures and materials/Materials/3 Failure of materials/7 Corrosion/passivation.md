#### What is
## Passivation
Passivation, in physical chemistry and engineering, refers to coating a material so it becomes "passive" that is, less readily affected or corroded by the environment. Passivation involves creation of an outer layer of shield material that is applied as a microcoating, created by chemical reaction with the base material, or allowed to build by spontaneous oxidation in the air.
