#### Whats the method for
## Determining the [[cathode]] and [[anode]]

To determine this we will need to find the electrode potential, this can be done useing either:
- [[the standard emf series]]
- [[the galvanic series]]

The series used varies on the solution connecting the materials.

The more intert material becomes the [[cathode]] and the more active material becomes the [[anode]].
The standard electrode potential between them can be found by calculating the difference in standard electrod potential.
