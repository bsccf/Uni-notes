#### Describe
## Ductile material failure appearance

#### Macroscopic appearance
In ductile materials you get [[necking]], the resaulting decrease in cross section and the extreme forces that resault often cause what's described as a "cup-cone" appearence:

The general properties of a [[ductility|ductile]] material failure are:
- It has a dimpled surface
- There is lots of plastic deformation
- There is slow crack propagation
- The failure is slow and gradual

#### Cup cone formation
Two sides one cup.

This is the process that causes the fracture:
1) Initial [[necking]] caused by stress concentration
2) Small voids form around hard [[secondary phase particles]]
3) The small voids overlap with eachother and coalese forming a larger internal crack.
4) Remaining connections between sides begin to shear
5) Failure occurs leaving a "cup-cone" fracture

#### Microscopic appearence

You can see how the void forms around the [[secondary phase particles]], (those bacteria looking things).
