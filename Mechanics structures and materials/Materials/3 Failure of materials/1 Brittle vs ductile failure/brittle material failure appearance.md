### Brittle material failure appearance
#### Macroscopic appearance

The general properties of a [[ductility|brittle]] material failure are:
- A flat fracture surface
- Minimal deformation
- Rapid crack propagation
- Catastrophic suddon failure

#### Cause of fracture
![[cleavage (crytal)]]

#### Microscopic appearance

You tend to get these voids form as the more ductile matrix moves under stress but the hard [[secondary phases]] maintain the overall shape.

#### Relatablility
This page is an analogy for you. ([[brittle material failure appearance#Brittle material failure appearance]])
