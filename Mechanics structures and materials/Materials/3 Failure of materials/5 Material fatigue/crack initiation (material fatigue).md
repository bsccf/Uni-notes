#### Describe
## Crack initiation ([[material fatigue]])
Cracks form within the material in response to a load.

This is the first stage of [[material fatigue]], though it could be skipped if there is already a stress concentrator in the material, this can be the form of sharp internal corners or fillets.

#### Cycles for crack initiation ($N_i$)
The number of cycles taken for crack initiation to occur within a material under those specific conditions.
