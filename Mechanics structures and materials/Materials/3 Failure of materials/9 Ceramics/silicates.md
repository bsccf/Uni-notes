#### What are
## Silicates
### Intro
These are a type of [[ceramics|ceramic]] consisting of silicon and oxygen. These are often [[crystalline materials|crystalline]]

The [[cation-anion radius ratio]] is 0.286, so there is a large size difference between the two [[ions]]:

### Structures
Silicates have a very wide number of forms which come from the structure of the silicate:

You can see it is also possible for layered [[silicates]] to form, in the one shown each silicate ion only has 3 oxygen atoms bonded with it, this resaults in a net negative charge. The charge is then satisfied by the charge of the neighbouring sheet.
