#### What are
## Ceramics
### Definition
A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials often made by shaping and then firing an inorganic, nonmetallic material.

### Common features
- Mostly [[ionic bonding]] though can have [[covalent bonding]].
- Generally made of a combination of metallic and non metallic elements, where metallic ions are [[cations]] and non metallic ions are [[anions]].
- Generally the [[cations]] will be smaller than the [[anions]] since they have lost there outer [[electron shell]].
- The structure is heavily effected by the realtive sizes of the ions and there charges.
