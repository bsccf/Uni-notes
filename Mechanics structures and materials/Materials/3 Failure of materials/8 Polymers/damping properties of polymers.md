#### Describe the
## Damping properties of [[polymers]]
### Introduction
This relates back to [[creep (materials)|creep]], especially in polymers there is a lag time between the stress and strain of a material, as discussed previously this can become increasingly complex as we introduce a time dependent modulus ([[relaxation modulus]]). If we start by considering a representiation of this lag graphically:

We can catagorise the difference in [[relaxation modulus]] using the following terms:

(note that load vs time is what is being applied to the different resposnes)

### Catagorisation between polymers
- [[thermosetting polymers]] have low damping capacity due to the 3D network of bonds
- [[thermoplastic]]s have a high damping capacity when in the temp range $T_g<T<T_m$ (where molecular chains are more mobile)

### Changing damping
It is possible to change the damping properties of polymers by:
- introducing addatives
- mixing multiple polymers to get averaged propeties (has limitations as you can imagine)
- [[copolymerisation]] with suitable momomers
