#### What is the method for
## Causing precipitation hardening
### Introduction

To cause [[precipitation hardening]] you need to:
- Control the formation of small evenly dispersed precipitates
- Use a 3 stage heat treatment
- [[well shit|Turn's out there is no 3rd bullet point]]

### Requirements
Precipitation strengthening is possible if the line of solid solubility slopes strongly toward the centre of a [[phase diagram basics|phase diagram]]. 

#### Example

The shaded area is where precipitation hardening can be preformed as it is where heat treatment can be used to move between the phases.

### 3 stage heat treatment
1) You start at a desireable temperature in the solid phase
2) You cool the substance incredibly quickly (usually water quenching) so it passes the [[solvus line]] and drops to a temperature too low for internal diffusion
3) You heat it back up to the correct temperature to allow age hardening to occur via controlled amounts of diffusion

What is actually happening on the atomic level at these stages is:
1) It starts in a normal solid phase
2) It crosses the [[solvus line]] too quickly for diffusion to occur along grain boundarys, so the dissolved substance cannot escape the lattice its trapped in because the temperature is too low.
3) It is hot enough for diffusion to occur but not enough for the foregin atom's to diffuse into grain boundaries so instead you get [[internal crystal grain precipitation]]. You can control the length of time and temperature to control the size of the precipitates that form within the structure.

This is stage 3, longer ageing creates larger precipitates.

### Time, temp and peak strength
Here you can see how overaging can lead to precipitates that are too large, which allows for them to be cut and decreases yield strength:

Higher temperatures increases the atom's energy allowing a higher [[temperatures effect on diffusion|diffusion rate]] but this also reduces peak strength as seen below:
