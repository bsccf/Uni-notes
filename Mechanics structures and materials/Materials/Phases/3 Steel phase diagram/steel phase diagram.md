#### Describe a
## Steel phase diagram
### Definitions
![[eutectoid reaction]]

### The diagram and its phases
![[Pasted image 20211117171632.png]]

Labels:
- (\*) A [[eutectic point]] where $L$ transitions to $\gamma+Fe_3 C$
- (\*\*) A [[eutectoid reaction]] where $\gamma$ transitions to $\alpha + Fe_3 C$
- ($\gamma$) [[austenite]]
- ($\alpha$) [[ferrite]]

#### [[hypoeutectoid|Hypoeutectoid]] Steel
This occurs when forming steels before the eutectoid point.

1) Transition from $\gamma$ to $\gamma+\alpha$, here [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] of $\alpha$ starts around the $\gamma$ grain boundarys
2) The $\alpha$ continues to grow
3) The $\alpha$ is basically fully formed
4) The temperature is too low for $\gamma$ to be stable it turns into [[pearlite]]

#### [[hypereutectoid|Hypereutectiod]] Steel
This occurs when forming steels after the eutectoid point.

It's basically the same process but with $Fe_3 C$ [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] around grain boundarys instead of $\alpha$
