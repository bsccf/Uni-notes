#### Describe what occurs throughout
## Microstructure formation during non equalibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility
If you want an indepth method refer to [[microstructure formation during equilibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility|this]].

When you don't have eqalibrium conditions there isn't sufficiant time for the Ni to diffuse within the alloy, this causes distinct layers to form around the [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] sites. This process that creates jawbreaker looking things is called coring.

#### Reminder that this is useful
A good understanding of [[phase diagram basics|phase diagram]]s allows for better manipulation of structures:
