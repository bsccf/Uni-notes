#### What are
## Tie-lines
### Desc
These are used to determine the relative amounts of two states in a [[phase diagram basics|phase diagram]] at a given point, it's easiest to explain through an example.

### Example
![[Pasted image 20211112165534.png]]

> $C_O=$ Composition of alloy ($\alpha+L$) at B (as a total nickle percentage)
> $C_L=$ Composition of the liquid parts ($L$) of this mixture
> $C_\alpha=$ Composition of the solid parts ($\alpha$) of this mixture

#### Description of real world situation
If you had a container that had copper and nickle in it (same as diagram above) then this is what the points above would be:
> $C_O=$ The % of the weight of the contents of the container that is nickle
> $C_L-$ The % of the weight of the liquid inside the container that is nickle
> $C_\alpha$ The % of the weight of the solid inside the container that is nickle

#### Lever rule
To determine the quantity of each phase at a given point we use the lever rule, simply put:

> ### $$ Amount\:of\:phase = \frac{opposite\:length}{overall\:length} $$ 

Using the current example:
Fraction that is solid = $\dfrac{C_0-C_L}{C_\alpha-C_L}$
Fraction that is liquid = $\dfrac{C_\alpha-C_0}{C_\alpha-C_L}$

(Fraction that is solid) + (Fraction that is liquid) = 1
Because... well think about it.
