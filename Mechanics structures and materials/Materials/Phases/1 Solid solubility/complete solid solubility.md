#### What is
## Complete solid solubility
### Definition
This is where both elements completely [[Diffusion notes|diffuse]] into eachother, to form a [[Crystal Structures|crystal structure]] without any [[internal crystal grain precipitation|precipitation]] occuring in the crystal, for the entire range of possible compositions.

So for a [[phase diagram basics]] to show complete solid solubility the elements that are being combined must be [[miscibility|miscible]] for all temperatures (atleast liquid -> solid that is).
