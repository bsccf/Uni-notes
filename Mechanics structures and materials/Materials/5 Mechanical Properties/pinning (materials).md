#### What is
## Pinning (materials)
In a crystalline material, [[dislocations]] can move through the lattice causing plastic deformation. Pinning points in a material inhibit [[dislocation motion]], requireing a greater amount of force to be required to overcome the barrier. This increases the materials strength and [[yield strength|yield point]].

There are 3 types of pinning:
1) [[point defects|Point defects]], these create stress fields in a material that prevent travelling dislocations from coming into direct contact (in the same way like charges repel), these inhibit [[dislocation motion]].

2) Alloying elements, impurity atoms introduced into a crystal are effectively [[point defects]], so the same rules apply.

3) [[precipitation hardening|Second phase precipitates]], these create internal physical blockades though which dislocations simply cannot pass. So the dislocation must bend around the precipitation which requires more energy and decreases the strength of the defect:

It is possible for [[interstitial atom]]s to sit in defects, pinning them and making it much harder for the dislocation to move:
