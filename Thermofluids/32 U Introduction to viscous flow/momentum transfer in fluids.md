#### Describe
## Momentum transfer in fluids
Basically as stated previously, fluids can experience shear force we call any that do [[viscous flow|viscous fuids]], upto now we have been only really looking at [[inviscid flow|inviscid fluids]] but that's gunna change. So yeah shear force, but unlike in solids shear can't be experienced by stationary things in fluids shear force between sections of fluid is a function of velocity. I say a function because modelling it can be a pain in the ass, as seen below by different types of fluid shears:

As you can see the mad lad known as Newton (the guy who invented gravity (before him there was [[a small quantity of trolling|no such thing as gravity]], people just floated around)) made a simple model of fluid viscosity and luckilly water, air and low viscosity hydrocarbons all follow it. We call this type [[newtonian fluids]] (creative naming).
