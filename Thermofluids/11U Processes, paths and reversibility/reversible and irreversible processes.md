#### What are
## Reversible and irreversible processes
### Reversible process
#### Definition
A reversible [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] that can reverse it's tragectory along a [[path (thermodynamics)|path]].

#### Characteristics
- zero friction
- [[heat]] transfer results in no temperature difference

#### Subcategory
Not all reversible process are the same, there are:
- [[internally reversible processes]]
- [[externally reversible processes]]
- [[fully reversible processes]]

#### Examples
- [[fully reversible processes]]: A [[quasi-equilibrium (thermodynamics)|quasi-equilibrium]] heat transfer process is the very slow expansion of very large and thin walled frictionless piston-cylinder at constant temperature.
- [[internally reversible processes|internally reversible process]]: A quasi-equilibrium heat transfer process with constant volume heating of a cold gas.
- [[reversible and irreversible processes|irreversible process]]: A quasi-equilibrium work process with the slow compression of a gas in an insulated piston-cylinder with friction present. (the friction is the bit that trolls you)

Basically reversibility-ism-ness is directly related to the generation of [[entropy]] in the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]].

### Irriversible processes
#### Definition
