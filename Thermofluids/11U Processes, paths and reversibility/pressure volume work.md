#### What is
## Pressure volume work
This is the work done as a resault of the change in volume of a pressurised fluid.

> ### $$ W = P\times(\Delta V) = \int P(V)\cdot dV $$ 
>> where:
>> $P=$ Pressure
>> $W=$ Work done
>> $\Delta V=$ Change in volume
>> $P(V)=$ P as a function of V

It should be noted that in a situation where P is changing you will need to use integration. (define P interms of V and integrate) This will usually involve the [[ideal gas law]].
