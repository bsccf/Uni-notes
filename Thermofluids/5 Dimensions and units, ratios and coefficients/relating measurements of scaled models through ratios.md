#### How would you go about
## Relating measurements of scaled models through ratios
### Method
1) Note given ratio measurements and their composing base units
2) Figure out how to get the desired measurement according to its base units from multiplieing known ratio base units
3) Use the combination of known ratios multiplied together to get the new ratio for the measurement you want

### Examples
1) 
>> If you have a water tank and a model and the ratio between the heights is 1:10 what is the ratio between the volumes?
> - Length $=m$
> - Volume $=m^3$
>
> So:
> $$ \begin{align*}
Volume = m^{3} = (m)^{3} &= (Length)^3\\
V_r &= (L_r)^3\\
 &= \frac{1}{10}^3\\
&= \frac{1}{1000} 
\end{align*} $$
> Hence the volume ratio is 1:1000

2) 
>>  What is the work ratio ($W_r$) if the force ratio is 1:50 and the distance ratio is 4:15
> - Work $= ML^{2}T^{-2}$
> - Force $= MLT^{-2}$
> - Distance $=L$
>
> So:
> $$ \begin{align*}\\
 Work =ML^{2}T^{-2} &= (MLT^{-2}) \cdot (L)\\
 Work &= (Force) \cdot (Distance) \\
 W_r &= F_r \cdot L_r\\
 W_r &= \frac{1}{50} \cdot \frac{4}{15}\\
&= \frac{2}{375}
\end{align*} $$
> Hence the work ratio is 2:375
