#### How can we represent
## Heat cycles in a PV diagram
### The diagram
![[Pasted image 20220104115058.png]]
Since we know on a [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]] the area under the line is the work done, by subtracting the work done on the gas from the work done by the gas we can find the useful work that can be extracted by finding the area inside the shape produced. That description was for [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat engines]], a [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat pump]] is basically the same except the area inside the shape is the input work used to drive the heat pump, basically look at the direction of the arrows to figure out if it is a [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat engine]] or a [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat pump]]:
- Clockwise is a [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat engine]]
- Anticlockwise is a [[heat engines and heat pumps|heat pump]]

### Useful notes (for future working) 
These are useful since they apply to all cycles and can allow us to simplify the working for finding the overall output of the machine:
- The initial and final points are the same hence the cycle [[internal energy]] is zero, hence: $\Sigma Q - \Sigma W = 0$ or $\Sigma Q = \Sigma W$
 - We also know that for [[p-v diagrams]] the inside the shape is work done and for [[TS diagram|T-S diagrams]] the area inside the shape is net heat transfer, so since $\Sigma Q = \Sigma W$, the area enclosed inside both shapes is the same.
