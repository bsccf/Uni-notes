#### What is
## Unsteady flow
If at any point in the fluid, the conditions change with time, the flow is described as unsteady. In practice there is always slight variations in velocity and pressure, but if the average values are constant, the flow is considered steady.

A good analogy is the result of eating the free [[eat it you fool|taco bell]] burrito that you can always find in the alleyway behind the resteraunt.

It is the opposite of [[steady flow]].
