#### What are the
## Equations needed for calculating changes between [[state (thermodynamics)|states]]


> ### $$ \begin{align*}Q_{12} - W_{12} &= E_{u12} \end{align*} $$ 
> ### $$ E_{h12} = Q_{12} $$ 
> ### $$ W_{12} = \int dW = \int^{V_2}_{V_1} P(V) \cdot dV $$ 
> ### $$ \frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2} $$ 
> ### $$ E_{u12} = mC_v (T_2-T_1) $$ 
> ### $$  dS =  \frac{dQ}{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Q_{12}=$ [[heat]] transfer from starting to ending state
>> $E_{u12}=$ [[internal energy]] change from starting to ending state
>> $E_{h12}=$ [[enthalpy]] change from starting to ending state
>> $W_{12}=$ work done from starting to ending state
>> $V=$ Volume
>> $T=$ Temperature
>> $P=$ Pressure
>> $P(V)=$ pressure as a function of volume
>> $S=$ [[entropy]]
