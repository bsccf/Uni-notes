#### What are the
## Types of process
### The types
 All of these use rearrangements of [[equations needed for calculating changes between states]].
 
There are 4 [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] types you need to know, you also need to know how they each look on [[p-v diagrams|pv diagrams]]. They are:
- [[isochoric heat transfer]]
- [[isobaric expansion or compression]]
- [[isothermal expansion or compression]]
- [[adiabetic expansion or compression]]
