#### What is the
## Carnot engine
#### Simpler desc
A Carnot heat engine is a theoretical engine that operates on the Carnot cycle.

### The carnot cycle

It consists of:
1)  ($1 \to 2$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal compression]], work is done on the gas causing heat to flow out of the gas to the low temp reserviour.
2) ($2 \to 3$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic compression]], work is done on the gas compressing it and increasing it's temp.
3) ($3 \to 4$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal expansion]], heat is transferred to the gas expanding it and the gas preforms work.
4) ($4 \to 1$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic]] expansion, the gas continues to expand preforming work without any heat transfer.

#### Properties of idealised carnot engine
- Fully reversible
- Consists of 4 processes
- It is a frictionless piston cylinder arrangement with perfectly insulated walls
- It is a theoreticall engine based on what would be theoretically most efficient, hence not really possible
- All heat transfer occurs between gas and heat sink/source
- Since it is reversible efficiency can be found using [[efficiency of a heat cycle#^a48207]]
