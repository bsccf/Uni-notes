#### What is the
## Second law of thermodynamics
### Description
First of all the second law of thermodynamics is [[highly unbased]].

The second law of thermodynamics is a general principle which places constraints upon the direction of heat transfer and the attainable efficiencies of heat engines. 

It is impossible to extract an amount of heat $Q_H$ from a hot reservoir and use it all to do work W. Some amount of heat $Q_C$ must be exhausted to a cold reservoir. This precludes a perfect heat engine. In other words (or diagrams):

The second situation is not possible.

An alternative way to describe this law is my prefered version "[[entropy]] increases", I know it is [[did you say random embedded meme|hard to remember]]... bit long.

### Some notes
- At best we can not increase entropy but never reduce the entropy of a closed system
- Open systems can reduce entropy, but this is just them dumping it outside themselfs so not acc removing it
- [[Life is pain]]
