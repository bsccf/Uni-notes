#### What is the
## Effect of angle of attack on the moment coefficient
#### How the angle of attack effects forces on the airfoil
Pressure moves with the angle of attack, which effects the [[Pitching moment coefficient]].

#### How the angle of attack effects moments
The slope of the graph relating to angle of attack also depends on the [[measuring pitching moments on a plane|point the moments is taken about]]:

This graph presents some important informataion, mainly the difference between the brown line and the red line, the brown line shows us what happens to the moment coefficient with no tail, the plane has a stronger nose up pitching moment with a greater angle of attack; this of course is a run away effect that is terrible for aircraft stability. The redline is the opposite, which means the plane will try to get back to level flight, hence this is the type of relationship between $C_m$ and angle we would want. 

#### Mathamatical representation

The variation of the [[Pitching moment coefficient]] is:

> $$ C_m = C_{mo} - h C_L $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_m =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]]
>> $C_{mo} =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]] at zero lift
>> $h =$ a constant
>> $C_L =$ [[Lift coefficient]]

This shows that the moment coefficient varys with the [[Lift coefficient]] which we already know varies with angle of attack.
