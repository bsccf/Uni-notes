#### What should be remembered when
## Measuring pitching moments on a plane
The value of pitching moments from different sources varys greatly depending on where you measure it from, so generally there are 3 positions we measure from:
- Front
- Back
- 1/4 main wing [[chord (aeronautics)|Chord]]

[[Pitching moment coefficient]] actually changes depending on where you measure from so keeping this in mind is incredibly important.

It should also be noted that by convention you generally measure positive moments as pitching the nose up (but this isn't enforces, it's just usually measured this way)
