#### How would you go about
## Basic aircraft trimming

Here the [[Pitching moment coefficient]] is especially important, as well as the [[Effect of angle of attack on the moment coefficient]].

The goal of aircraft trimming so to achieve no net moments in a given axis through the centre of mass, to make the plane more stable and easyer to control. 

### Pitch trimming

To trim for pitch in steady flight at a given speed (hence you know the value of the [[Lift coefficient]]) there must be no net pitching moment about the centre of gravity; hence the pitching moment should be zero at the angle of attack that gives the desired [[Lift coefficient]] (so the graph should cross the axis at this angle).

To get the correct pitching moment for stable flight a tailplane becomes important:

It should also be noted that control surfices on the tailplane allow for trimming for various speeds and conditions. 

### Concepts that aid trimming

Here are some further concepts used to help optamise stability and calculate moments:
- [[Centre of pressure]]
- [[aerodynamic centre]]
