# Endurance and range of jet aircraft
You know what, fuck it you get to listen to this:
![[final_60ab9dae96c7c5006142d87c_917341.mp4#play]]
It's partially a meme, but also based. These took ages to do, so yeah, appreciate the fact I actually explain wtf is going on, unlike the given notes.

All the embeds will be focused on flight only, ignoring the costs of fuel for takeoff/landing ect. (because this is supposed to be "easy")

![[the rate at which aircraft weight decreases]]

![[calculating aircraft fuel at a given time]]

![[calculating aircraft range]]

![[comparing maximum range and maximum endurance]]

![[calculating range in the statosphere]]

![[cruise climb with constant speed]]

![[maximising the breguet range (in the stratosphere)]]
