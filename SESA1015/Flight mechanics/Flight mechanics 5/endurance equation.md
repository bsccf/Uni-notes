[[calculating aircraft fuel at a given time#^d0cc24|This is the proof]]
> ### $$T' =\frac{1}{s} \frac{L}{D}  \ln( 1+\frac{W_f}{W_s })$$ 
>> where:
>> $T'=$ [[endurance]]
>> $s=$ [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|specific fuel consumption]]
>> $\frac{L}{D}=$ [[lift to drag ratio]]
>> $W_f=$ weight of fuel at start
>> $W_s=$ dry weight
