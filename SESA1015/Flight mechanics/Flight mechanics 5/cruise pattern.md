#### What is an aircrafts
## Cruise pattern
Basically to maintain a constant [[lift to drag ratio]] your lift needs to decrease with your weight [[the rate at which aircraft weight decreases|because of fuel being burned]].

So to decrease lift, we need to change atleast one of the values which determine it:
![[lift equation#^1f2714]]

Here we have the choice of changing:
- density
-  true airspeed
-  angle of attack ([[effect of angle on lift coefficient|see why]])

How these things are changed throughout the flight is called the [[cruise pattern]]/cruise climb technique.

### Examples of techniques
- [[cruise climb with constant speed]]
- [[constant altitude and angle of attack cruise pattern (jet)]]
