### Distinct speeds
During take off the aircraft accelerates from rest through several important speeds, these are important for the pilot to keep in mind during take off to do so safely ([[assuming they do not want to die]]).

![[decision speed]]

![[rotation speed]]

![[lift off speed]]

![[screen speed]]

The order that these occur in is:
1) [[decision speed]]
2) [[rotation speed]]
3) [[lift off speed]]
4) [[screen speed]]

There are also the following speeds you should be aware of:
- [[stalling speed for take off]]
- [[minimum unstick speed]]
- [[minimum control speed]]
