#### What is the relationship with
## Load factor against bank angle

We know that [[stalling speed]] is directly related to the [[load factor]] of the aircraft during a [[co-ordinated turn]], this graph shows a bunch of stuff:
- As you approach 90 degrees both increase and at 90 degrees are inf
- Stalling speed continues to increase, so the minimum speed you can fly at is increasing
- You must fly faster for greater [[bank angle]]s to avoid stall
