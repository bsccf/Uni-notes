#### How do you find the
## Ratio of stalling speed for a co-ordinated turn
### Useful bit
> ### $$ \frac{V_{Sr}}{V_S} = \sqrt n $$ 
>> where:
>> $V_{Sr}=$ stalling speed for a co-ordinated turn
>> $V_S=$ [[stalling speed]]
>> $n=$


### Math
We can get the equation for [[stalling speed]] from well, that little link <--- (I hope you know that's a link, because if you only just realized that I have no clue what you have been doing with these notes. {more importantly it would mean you have missed 99% of my [[memes]]} )

We can describe weight during a [[co-ordinated turn]] as equal to $Wn=L$ from the [[load factor]].
By default this [[stalling speed]] equation is defined for [[Steady level flight]], so in that case $W=L$.

$$\begin{align*}
V_S &= \sqrt \frac{2L}{S \rho C_{Lmax}} & V_{Sr} &= \sqrt \frac{2L}{S \rho C_{Lmax}}\\
V_S &= \sqrt \frac{2W}{S \rho C_{Lmax}} & V_{Sr} &= \sqrt \frac{2Wn}{S \rho C_{Lmax}}\\
\frac{V_{Sr}}{V_S}&=  \frac{\sqrt\frac{2Wn}{S \rho C_{Lmax}}}{\sqrt\frac{2W}{S \rho C_{Lmax}}}\\
&= \sqrt n
\end{align*}$$
