#### What is
## dynamic pressure
It's basically the kinetic energy per unit volume, it can be thought of as the pressure caused by the movement of air.
In incompressible fluid dynamics this is:

> $$ q = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 $$ 
>> where:
>> $q =$ dynamic pressure
>> $\rho =$ fluid density
>> $v =$ flow speed
