#### How can we find
## Centre of gravity of a volume of revolution
Here we use the theory from [[volume of a solid of revolution]] and [[centroid of a plane area|centre of area of a graph]] ([[lmao I am lazy|lookup proof if you need one]]), here we are working around the x axis:

We can instantly tell that the centre lies on the x axis hence $\bar{Y} = 0$, we need to use moments to find $\bar{X}$.

The equation for $\bar{X}$ is given by:

> ### $$ \bar{X} = \frac{\pi}{V} \int^{b}_a x[f(x)]^{2}\cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $V=$ [[volume of a solid of revolution#^c703d0|volume of revolution around x axis]] 
>> $f(x)=$ function of the curve that defines our shape
>> $\bar{X}=$ centre of gravity
>> $a,b=$ limits
