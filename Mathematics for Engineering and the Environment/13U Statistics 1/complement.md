#### What is a
## Complement ($-$)

Litterally just a not statement:

> ### $$ -A = \neg A = \bar{A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $A=$ some event 
>> $-=$ [[complement]] (not sure if we are allowed to use $\neg$ but it's just a better symbol lets [[get real|be real]]) 

Usually used to express the probability of something happening but can also be used to express logic.
