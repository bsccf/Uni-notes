# Addition of vectors

This is quite simple

> $$ \underline{a}+\underline{b} = ( (\underline{a}_x + \underline{b}_x), (\underline{a}_y + \underline{b}_y) ) = \vec{OC} $$ 

When adding two vectors you kinda just add their components in each axis together, or if they are parralel you can just add their magnitudes.

#### Subtraction of vectors

The methods basically the same as adding you just do that but subtract instead (I know it's shocking), you could also think of it as adding a vector multiplied by -1 [[Scalars and vectors]]. The only real thing to watch out for is when drawing negative vectors you need to flip the direction.
