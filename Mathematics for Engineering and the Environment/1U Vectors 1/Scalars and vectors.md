# Scalars and vectors

Quantitys that only have a magnitude and no direction are known as scalars, while quantitys that have both magnitude and direction and known as vectors.

## Vector properties

#### Notation
Vector variables are written with lines under them or bold eg: $\underline{a}$

#### Assigning a vector

<span style="border-color:#0ba7f4;border-style:solid;margin-inline:5px;padding:3px"> $\underline{a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ </span>

Ofcourse it is also possible to define a vector by giving a magnitude and direction, or defining it interms of pre-existing vector(s).

#### Equality

Vectors can be said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction, and this is expressed with a normal $\underline{a}=\underline{b}$ sign.

#### Multiplication by scalar

Vectors can be multiplied by any numerical value, doing so can change the direction if the value is negative.

#### Modulus

You can get the magnitude of a vector using the modulus function:
> $|\underline{a}|$
> $|\vec{OA}|$
