#### Whats a
## Higher derivative definition
These are just functions that have been differentiated multiple times they are expressed like the following:

#### Second order
> $$ \frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}} = \ddot{f}(x) = f^{(2)}(x) $$ 

#### Third order
> $$ \frac{d^{3}f}{dx^{3}} = \dddot{f}(x) = f^{(3)}(x) $$ 

#### $n^{th}$ order
> $$ \frac{d^{n}f}{dx^{3}} = f^{(n)}(x) $$
