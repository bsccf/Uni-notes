#### What is a
## Ordinary differential equation
#### Definition
An ordinary differential equation is a [[Differential Equations 1 overview|differential equation]] containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions.
This is used in contrast of [[partial differential equation]].

This is a long way of saying that they look like:

#### Examples
$$\begin{align*}
   \frac{dy}{dx} &= y + x^{2} - 5f(x)\\
\frac{dv}{dt} &= 3t^{4} - 69420 + ke^{1}k &k&=constant 
\end{align*}$$
