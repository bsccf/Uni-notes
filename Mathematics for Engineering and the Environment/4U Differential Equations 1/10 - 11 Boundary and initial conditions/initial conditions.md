#### What are
## Initial conditions
### Def
These are a special case of [[boundary conditions]]. 
This is where all [[boundary conditions]] are given at the same value of the [[independent variables|independent variable]].

### Example
> $f(t)=A\sin (\lambda t) + B\cos (\lambda t)$, and $f(0)=21$, $\frac{d}{dx} f(0)=69$

Here all boundary conditions are given for when $x=0$, hence they are [[initial conditions]].
