#### What are the differences between
## Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations
### Complex and deep explenation

If you format the equation so that [[dependent variables]] and [[independent variables]] are on opposite sides of the equals sign then:
- Differential Homogeneous  equation - [[independent variables|independent variables]] equal to zero
- Differential Nonhomogeneous equation - Not equal to zero


### Example
#### Homogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
    \frac{dx}{dt}+ 4x &= 0\\
4 \frac{dx}{dt} + x\sin t &= 0\\
\end{align*}$$

#### Nonhomogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
   \frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}} + t \frac{dx}{dt} &= 4 \sin t\\
\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}} - 4x \frac{df}{dx} &= 420t^{69}
\end{align*}$$
