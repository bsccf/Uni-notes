# Statistics 1 overview

#### Intro and contents
[[This statement is false|I love stats]], it's the only thin in maths more [[hahaha no|enjoyable]] than matrices.

I'm not going to explain everything, if you don't understand something check the textbook, I'm assuming atleast a GCSE level understanding of probablity and stuff:
- [[symbols for event relationships]]
- [[independent events]]
- [[dependent events]]
- [[conditional probablility]]
- [[finding the number of combinations]]
- [[probablility function]]
- [[mean median and mode of continous probability functions]]
- [[standard deviation for probabability functions]]
